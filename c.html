				<p>C is certainly the most difficult language that is featured on this website. Its syntax is unforgiving, and it lacks certain basic features like strings. That being said, if a person takes the time to really learn the ins and outs of C, they can expect to make some very powerful programs. concepts like pointers can be extremely difficult for beginners, but when used to their full potential, they can make a program incredibly fast. I would not recommend that anyone start learning C as their first language, unless it’s for a class or they have someone helping them along the way.</p>
