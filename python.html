				<p>Python is a great language for beginners. The language uses many tricks under the hood to interpret what the programmer means without any extra input from the coder. For anyone new to coding this can be a lifesaver, as many other languages require the user to specify many things and use programming specific terms. One example of this can be seen logic. For instance, in almost every language the words for and / or are && / || respectively. But in python you can simply use the literal words and / or. For new coders this can save a lot of the headage associated with learning something new, but for experienced coders this can often be seen as annoying as it differs from almost every other language. Overall, Python is a great language and, in my opinion, is the best for beginners.</p>
