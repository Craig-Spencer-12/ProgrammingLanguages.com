				<p>Hi, I'm Craig Spencer, the creator of ProgrammingLanguages.com. I am currently a sophomore at Arizona State University with nearly five years of coding experience. I was lucky to begin my coding career in highschool with a quality teacher, but I know that many people are not fortunate enough to have the same start as me. That is why I decided to create this website. I want everyone to have a place to begin their coding adventures without the fears associated with diving into a new field. So thank you for visiting and supporting my website, and I hope you enjoy your stay!</p>
