				<p>Java is the world’s most popular language, and it is a great place to start. It may not be the easiest language in existence, but it does have the largest community and many great tutorials online. Java is fairly simple, but it does have few qualities that make it more difficult than some of the most basic languages. Java's most central quality that makes it a bit complex is that it is object-oriented. This concept could be an entire discussion in and of itself, but essentially object-oriented languages have a specific way of organizing and packaging code that is not exactly intuitive. Overall java is a low difficulty language but requires the use of some tutorials and patience to be understood well.</p>
