				<p>Go is a fairly new open source language created by google. This language could be considered the most technically complex language on this site, but the way it was designed makes it easy for beginners to get involved too. The most important difference between go and other languages is a thing called "goroutines". A goroutine is essentially a chuck of code that is run at the same time as other chunks of code. There are currently very few languages that are able to multitask like this. This concept is certainly not something for beginners but it's good to know once you become a more experienced programmer. This language is not the best for beginners but has great features for those who know what they are doing.</p>
